  <label>{{ label() }}</label>

  <!-- The problem is Angular does not care about which content might eventually end up in your components template
   . It only cares about what is sees in your components template. 
   Here it just sees a placeholder in ng-content, not actual text-area and input.  -->
  <ng-content select="input, textarea" />
